Features:

(Modelling Transformation)

Imported OBJ models and glut primitives (sphere, cube...)
QUAD particles (stars)
Bitmap fonts


(Trivial Rejections)

Back culling


(Illumination)

Up to 5 light sources:
- Orange light coming from big sun. (Directed source)
- Ambient light
- Up to 3 additional suns as obstacles (Point source)

Diffuse and specular illumination.


(Viewing Transformation)

Basic tranformations (translate, rotate, scale)


(Clipping)

The depth buffer to display obstacles correctly


(Projection)

orthogonal view for the title screen, the statistics and the game over screen
perspective for the rest


(Rasterisation)

Antialiasing (using GL_LINE_SMOOTH)
Texture mapping for obstacles, and the title & game over screens
Mipmapping textures for obstacles
Alpha blending for glass panels
Fog


(Display)

The game adapts to the display size.


(Other Game Features)

3 levels of difficulty (increased obstacle spawn rate, obstacles move faster and fog is closer)
Player animations (rotates when duck gets hit, and flashes when he looses a life)
Obstacles animations (cubes/torus move, cones scale, (Marc may implement more)
Collision detection using bounding sphere intersection.
Linked list as data structure for obstacles (I still think it's a feature even if TA disagrees...)
Use of random number generator for obstacle creation, and stars
(Unsure: Explosions, particle effects, ???)
